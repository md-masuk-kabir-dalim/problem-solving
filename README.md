1. Binary Search Implementation in JavaScript

This project features a straightforward implementation of **Binary Search** in JavaScript.  
Binary Search is an efficient algorithm for finding a target value within a **sorted array**.  
It works in **O(log n)** time by repeatedly dividing the search space in half.

### âœ… Features
- Works on sorted arrays
- Returns the index of the target element
- Returns -1 if the element is not found
